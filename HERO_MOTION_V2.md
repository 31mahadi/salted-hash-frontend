## ðŸŽ¯ What's New

### âœ¨ Cinematic Hero Section (`HeroSectionV2`)

**1. Advanced Background System (`CyberGrid`)**
- Animated gradient base that pulses between cyan/purple
- Live cyber grid with 50x50px cells
- 15 network nodes with connecting lines that animate
- Parallax light rays that follow mouse movement
- 30 floating particles with random drift
- Continuous scan line effect (8s cycle)

**2. Blur-Reveal Headline Animation**

```

---

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations

### GPU Acceleration
- All animations use `transform` and `opacity`
- Hardware-accelerated properties only
- No layout thrashing

### Lazy Loading
- `useInView` for service cards (load on scroll)
- `-100px` margin for early trigger
- `once: true` to prevent re-animation

### Reduced Motion Support
- All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Fallback to instant transitions
- Maintains functionality without motion

### Code Splitting
- Client components marked explicitly
- Server components for data fetching
- Minimal client-side JavaScript

## ðŸŽ¯ Motion Principles

### 1. **Anticipation**
- Elements wind up before moving
- Creates natural, physical feel

### 2. **Follow Through**
- Motion continues after main action
- Spring physics for organic bounce

### 3. **Staging**
- Clear visual hierarchy
- One focal point at a time

### 4. **Ease In/Out**
- No linear motion
- All transitions use easing curves

### 5. **Overlapping Action**
- Multiple elements move at once
- Creates depth and richness

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Premium Design Touches

### Depth Layers
```
Layer 1: Background gradient (far)
Layer 2: Cyber grid + particles (mid-far)
Layer 3: Light rays (mid)
Layer 4: Content (front)
Layer 5: Vignette (overlay)
```

### Glow Effects
- Soft, diffused glows (not harsh)
- Multiple shadow layers
- Color-matched to brand
- Subtle pulsing animation

### Typography
- 96px+ headlines (impossible to miss)
- Gradient text with animation
- Light subheadings (elegant contrast)
- Perfect letter-spacing

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies
```typescript
// Framer Motion
import { motion, useTransform, useScroll, useSpring }

// Spring Physics
const mouseXSpring = useSpring(x, {
  stiffness: 150,
  damping: 15,
  mass: 0.1
});

// Parallax
const y = useTransform(scrollY, [0, 500], [0, 150]);

// 3D Transforms
style={{
  rotateX,
  rotateY,
  transformStyle: "preserve-3d"
}}
```
