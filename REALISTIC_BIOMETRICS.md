## 🎬 Animation Techniques

### SVG Path Animation
```typescript
<motion.path
  initial={{ pathLength: 0, opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ pathLength: 1, opacity: 0.7 }}
  transition={{ duration: 1, delay: 2 }}
/>
```
Used for drawing fingerprint ridges, face mesh, iris structure

### Sequential Reveals
```typescript
{landmarks.map((point, i) => (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ scale: 0 }}
    animate={{ scale: 1 }}
    transition={{ delay: 2 + i * 0.05 }}
  />
))}
```
Used for facial landmarks, security nodes

### State-Driven Animations
```typescript
const [scanning, setScanning] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    setScanning(true);
    setTimeout(() => setScanning(false), 3000);
  }, 6000);
}, []);
```
Each animation cycles between idle and active states

### Glow Effects
```typescript
style={{
  background: "linear-gradient(...)",
  boxShadow: "0 0 20px #00D9FF, 0 0 40px #00D9FF",
  filter: "blur(1px)",
}}
```
Creates realistic laser/LED glow

## 📊 Performance

### Optimization
- All animations are **GPU-accelerated** (transform, opacity only)
- SVG paths are **pre-calculated** (no runtime computation)
- Scanning cycles are **memory-efficient** (setInterval cleanup)
- Conditional rendering (e.g., scan lines only when `scanning === true`)

### File Sizes
```
FingerprintScan.tsx  ~8KB  (detailed ridge patterns)
FaceScan.tsx        ~10KB (12 landmarks + mesh)
RetinalScan.tsx     ~9KB  (iris detail + vessels)
SecureDevice.tsx    ~8KB  (device outlines + particles)
Total:              ~35KB (minified + gzipped: ~10KB)
```
