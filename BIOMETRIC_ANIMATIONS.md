## 🎨 Design Principles

### Positioning Strategy
```
     [Fingerprint]              [Face Scan]
            \                      /
              \                  /
                \              /
                  [  HERO  ]
                /              \
              /                  \
            /                      \
    [Secure Device]            [Retinal]
```

**Strategic placement:**
- Top corners: Active scanning (fingerprint, face)
- Bottom corners: Verification complete (retinal, devices)
- Creates visual frame around hero content
- Guides eye toward center CTA buttons

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Opacity:** 25-30% (subtle, not distracting)
2. **Delay:** Staggered (1.5s, 2s, 2.5s, 3s)
3. **Duration:** 3-4s per animation cycle
4. **Colors:** Match brand (cyan, purple, pink)

## 🎬 Animation Techniques

### 1. **Path Drawing** (SVG pathLength)
```typescript
<motion.ellipse
  initial={{ pathLength: 0, opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ pathLength: 1, opacity: 0.6 }}
  transition={{ duration: 2, delay: 1.5 }}
/>
```

### 2. **Sequential Reveals**
```typescript
{points.map((point, i) => (
  <motion.circle
    initial={{ scale: 0 }}
    animate={{ scale: 1 }}
    transition={{ delay: 2.5 + i * 0.1 }}
  />
))}
```

### 3. **Continuous Rotation**
```typescript
<motion.div
  animate={{ rotate: 360 }}
  transition={{
    duration: 4,
    repeat: Infinity,
    ease: "linear"
  }}
/>
```

### 4. **Pulsing Effects**
```typescript
animate={{
  scale: [1, 1.2, 1],
  opacity: [0.3, 0.6, 0.3]
}}
transition={{
  duration: 3,
  repeat: Infinity
}}
```

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Change Colors
```typescript
// Fingerprint (currently cyan)
className="text-primary"  // Change to text-purple, text-accent, etc.

// Face Scan (currently purple)
className="text-purple"   // Change to text-primary, text-accent, etc.
```

### Adjust Position
```typescript
// Move fingerprint to right
className="absolute top-1/4 right-[10%]"  // was left-[10%]

// Move face scan lower
className="absolute top-1/2 right-[12%]"  // was top-1/3
```

### Modify Speed
```typescript
// Slower animation
transition={{ duration: 4 }}  // was 2

// Longer delay
transition={{ delay: 3 }}  // was 1.5
```

### Increase/Decrease Opacity
```typescript
// More visible
className="opacity-40"  // was opacity-30

// More subtle
className="opacity-15"  // was opacity-30
```
